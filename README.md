# TensorFlow-Python-Neural-Network-Example
<h1>Working example of the example program described on the TensorFlow MINST Pro Tutorial</h1>
<p>The original instructions are mentioned on https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros
It is inherently strange that the entire source code is not attached over there at the time of writing this. Pieces of the entire source scattered with explaination makes for a good tutorial but a bad idea for actaully implementing it so that it <b>"just works"</b>.</p>
